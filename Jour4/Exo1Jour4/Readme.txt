*** Created an inspector that can spawn an enemy type based on the selection in a drop down list
*** When you click the button create, the selected enemy will be spawn on the scene
*** After spawning an enemy, the button create will change directly to Swap
*** The swap button will swap the last enemy you spawned by the current selected enemy type on the list.

Plus
*** When you click in the inspector but not the button, the swap button will change to create button so that
you can spawn a new type of enemy again
*** Created the exact same features but in an editor window: Enemy > Create enemy...
